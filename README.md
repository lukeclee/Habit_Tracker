# Habit_Tracker
Habit Tracking app I wrote using C# and ASP.NET MVC

The habit tracker I built to simply keep track of the tasks that I want to do on a regular basis, like practice programming. 
I built this to practice C# and learn MVC. 

Clicking the habits tab at the top brings you to the table of habits that you want to keep track of using the app.

The buttons on this page include Create Habit which allows you to enter the Habit name and how many times a week you want to perform the task.
The Track button increments the Current Count by one, once the Current Count is equal to or greater than the Weekly Goal, the Goal Is Met? field becomes
true. The Edit button allows you to edit the name and weekly goal number of the habit. The Delete button removes the habit from the table and the database.

Things I still want to implement: 
- allowing multiple users
- updating the UI 
- hosting the database
